Check if RequirePrivateStoreOnly=1 in these locations:

HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore

If so delete the key or set it to 0. Then from start run wsreset.exe. It will auto open the store, if itâ€™s still blocked close and reopen the store again.

1. Group Policy Restrictions:
Check Local Security Policy:
Open secpol.msc and navigate to Application Control Policies > AppLocker > Packaged app Rules. If you find a rule with a "Deny" action for Microsoft Store, delete it. 
Review Group Policy Editor:
Open gpedit.msc and navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Store. Check for policies related to disabling the Store or blocking apps from the store, and ensure they are set to "Not Configured" or disabled. 
Check for "Require Private Store" setting:
This setting, if enabled via GPO, Intune, or registry, can also block the store. If it's enabled, either delete the related registry key or set its value to 0. 
2. AppLocker Rules:
If AppLocker is blocking access to the Store, you'll need to create a new rule that allows it. This can be done within the Group Policy Management Editor by navigating to AppLocker > Packaged app Rules and creating a new rule that allows the Microsoft Store app. 
3. Service Issues:
Ensure the "Application Identity service" is running. Open services.msc and start the service if it's not running.
