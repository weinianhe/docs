Key functionalities of Select-String:
Pattern Matching: It searches for specified text patterns using regular expressions.
Input Flexibility: It can search within individual strings, arrays of strings, or the contents of files.
Output Details: By default, it returns MatchInfo objects for each match, including the filename, line number, and the entire line containing the match.
Customization:
-SimpleMatch: Treats the search pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.
-Pattern: Specifies the pattern to search for (can be a single string or an array of strings).
-Path: Specifies the path to files to search within. Wildcards are supported.
-InputObject: Accepts objects as input, allowing you to search within their properties or converted string representations.
-CaseSensitive: Performs a case-sensitive search.
-NotMatch: Returns lines that do not contain the specified pattern.
-Context: Displays lines before and/or after the matching line for context.
-AllMatches: Finds all occurrences of the pattern within a line, not just the first one.
-List: Stops searching in a file after the first match is found.
Basic Example:
Code

"This is a sample string." | Select-String -Pattern "sample"
This command will output the MatchInfo object for the line containing "sample".
Searching in a file:
Code

Select-String -Path "C:\Logs\ErrorLog.txt" -Pattern "Error" -CaseSensitive
